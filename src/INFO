== common ==
	Contains utility headers and code shared between at least two of the
	following components.


Communication between ftpif/slave/webif/sitebot and the master happens
via an HTTP-based protocol and JSON-formatted data.


== ftpif (mandatory) ==
	Handles incoming FTP client connections.

	Single threaded, event-based.

== master (mandatory) ==
	* Manages users
	* Manages the VFS
	* Slaves connect here
	* Distributes events

	Mostly single threaded, but offloads possibly long-running tasks
	to their own threads (which call back into the main thread via
	an appropriate async signaling mechanism). Actor model?

== sitebot (optional) ==
	IRC site bot.

== slave (mandatory) ==
	Well, the transfer slave.

	Should probably use a thread pool for maximum concurrency.
	Investigate Actor model too.

== webif (optional) ==
	Provides a convenient web interface.

	Single threaded.
